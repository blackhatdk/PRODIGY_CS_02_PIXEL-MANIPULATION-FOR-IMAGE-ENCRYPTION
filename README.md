# PIXEL MANIPULATION FOR IMAGE ENCRYPTION

Pixel manipulation for image encryption involves the process of modifying the RGB values of each pixel in an image using cryptographic algorithms or secret keys to render the image unreadable without proper decryption. During encryption, the RGB values of pixels are altered in a controlled manner to obscure the image's content while maintaining its visual appearance. Decryption reverses this process, restoring the original image by applying the inverse operations with the correct decryption key or algorithm. While pixel manipulation serves as a fundamental technique for image encryption, it's important to recognize its limitations in providing robust security against sophisticated attacks, making it more suitable for educational or basic encryption purposes within larger security frameworks.

```
pip install pillow
```

# For Windows

### HOW TO USE...

I recommend running the code in a Python IDE such as PyCharm or simply using Python.

Step 1: Download the zip file and extract it.

Step 2: Run the "main.py" on Python IDE.

Step 3: Setup the python environment .

Step 4: Before "Execute" the program and  make sure import your image path.

Step 5: Run the program.
